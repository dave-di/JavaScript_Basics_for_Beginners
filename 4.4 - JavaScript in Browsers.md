## The Script Element  

- There are two places you can add the script element <script></script> 

- One is in the head section of an html document(not advised) 

- The other is on the bottom 

- The best practice is to put it on the bottom, in the body section 

- Html is parsed from top to bottom 

- The page needs time to render the document before it can load the JavaScript effectively 

- It may not work properly if you're using JavaScript before the page has had time to load 

- It's a bad user experience to execute JavaScript first before the document has loaded 

- JavaScript needs to talk to the elements on the webpage 

- By putting JavaScript at the end of the page, we can be confident that all the content above will be rendered by the browser 

- Third party code using JavaScript may need to put in the head section, however these are exceptions 

  

## Statements and Comments  

- A statement is a piece of code that expresses an action to be carried out such as console.log('Hello World'); 

- console.log('Hello World') tells the browser to send this message to the console 

- All statements in JavaScript should be terminated with a semicolon ; 

- Hello World' is a string or a sequence of characters 

- // represents a comment and is ignored by the JavaScript engine 

- Comments are purely for documenting the code 

- Comments should explain why you have written this code 

- Comments should not explain what the code does, as it should be obvious  

- alt + cmd + i(mac) or ctrl + alt + i(windows) will bring up inspect on Chrome, which can accessed by clicking on the console tab
