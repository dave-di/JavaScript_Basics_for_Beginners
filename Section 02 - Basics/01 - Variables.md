## Variables 

- Stores data temporarily in a computer's memory 

- We can give the memory location a name 

- var can/was used to declare a variable in JavaScript 

- let is a more modern way to declare a variable and should be used instead 

- Giving a variable a name is like putting a label on a box 

- let name; declares the variable with the label name  

- The semi-colon terminates the declaration of the variable 

- the variable remains undefined by default till we initialize the variable 

- let name='David'; initializes the variable  

- 'David' is set to a string which is a sequence of characters 

- Strings can use single or double quotes('David' or "David") 

- More common to use single quotes for strings using JavaScript 

- You can declare two or more variables on a single line separating them with a comma, however best practice is to terminate them with a semi-colon and begin a new line for each variable 

 

## Rules for naming variables 

- Cannot be a reserved keyword such as let or if 

- Variables should be meaningful and descriptive 

- Cannot start with a number such as 1name 

- Cannot contain a space or hyphen  

- Camel notation such as firstName is used to glue words together to name your variables 

- Camel notation is when you make the letter of the first word lower came and the following words starting with Upper case letters 

- Variable are case sensitive 

- 'firstName' and 'FirstName' are two different variables
