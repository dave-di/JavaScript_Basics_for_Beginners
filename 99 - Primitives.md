## Primitives / value types 

- There are different value types in JavaScript 

- String, Number, Boolean, undefined, null 

- let name = 'Dave'; (string literal) 

- let age = 30; (Number literal) 

- let isApproved = true (Boolean literal) 

- let firstName = undefined;  

- let lastName = null 

- Booleans can be set to true or false and is used for logical instances 

- a variable can be set to undefined but it's no common 

- we use null when we want to clear the value of a variable
